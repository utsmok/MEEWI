---
Filters can be used to narrow down the search results based on specific criteria. Filters are provided as query parameters in the request URL (see [here](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/) for the available search entpoints).

Multiple filters can be provided in a single request; they should be formatted as follows: `param1=value1&param2=value2&...&paramN=valueN`.

note

Filters are combined using the logical `AND` operator. If a filter is provided multiple times, its values are combined using the logical `OR` operator. For more information on how to use logical operators when searching and filtering, see [Using logical operators](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/#using-logical-operators).

Examples:

- Get all research products that contain the word `"covid"`, sorted by popularity in descending order:
	[https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?search=covid&sortBy=popularity DESC](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?search=covid&sortBy=popularity%20DESC)
- Get all publications that are published after `2019-01-01`:

## Using logical operators[​](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/#using-logical-operators "Direct link to heading")

The API supports the use of logical operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to refine your search queries. These operators help you combine or exclude one or more values for a specific filter.

### `AND` operator[​](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/#and-operator "Direct link to heading")

Use the `AND` operator to retrieve results that include all specified values. This narrows your search.

Examples:

- Get research products that contain both `"climate"` and `"change"`:
	[https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?search=climate AND change](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?search=climate%20AND%20change)
- Get research products that are classified with both Fields of Study (FOS) `"03 medical and health sciences"` and `"0502 economics and business"`:
	[https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?fos="03 medical and health sciences" AND "0502 economics and business"](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?fos=%2203%20medical%20and%20health%20sciences%22%20AND%20%220502%20economics%20and%20business%22)

note

Note that when multiple tokens denote a single filter value, you should enclose them in double quotes, as in the FOS example above.

### `OR` operator[​](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/#or-operator "Direct link to heading")

Use the `OR` operator to retrieve results that include any of the specified terms. This broadens your search. The same functionality can be achieved by providing multiple times the same query parameter or using a comma to separate the values.

Examples:

- Get research products with the OpenAIRE ids `doi_dedup___::2b3cb7130c506d1c3a05e9160b2c4108` or `pmid_dedup__::1591ebf0e0698ed4a99455ff2ba4adc0`:
	[https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?id=r3730f562f9e::539da48b3796663b17e6166bb966e5b1 OR pmid\_dedup\_\_::1591ebf0e0698ed4a99455ff2ba4adc0](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?id=r3730f562f9e::539da48b3796663b17e6166bb966e5b1%20OR%20pmid_dedup__::1591ebf0e0698ed4a99455ff2ba4adc0)
- Get projects that are connected to organizations in the US or Greece:
	[https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/projects?relOrganizationCountryCode=US OR GR](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/projects?relOrganizationCountryCode=US%20OR%20GR)
	or by using the same query parameter multiple times: [https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/projects?relOrganizationCountryCode=US&relOrganizationCountryCode=GR](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/projects?relOrganizationCountryCode=US&relOrganizationCountryCode=GR)
	or just using comma: [https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/projects?relOrganizationCountryCode=US,GR](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/projects?relOrganizationCountryCode=US,GR)

### `NOT` operator[​](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/#not-operator "Direct link to heading")

Use the `NOT` operator to exclude specific terms from your search results. This refines your search by filtering out unwanted results.

Examples:

- Get research products that contain `"semantic"` but not `"web"`:
	[https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?search=semantic NOT web](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?search=semantic%20NOT%20web)
- Get all data sources that are not journals:
	[https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/dataSources?dataSourceTypeName=NOT Journal](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/dataSources?dataSourceTypeName=NOT%20Journal)

note

All the above operators can be combined, along with parentheses, and quotes to create more complex queries. For example, to get research products that contain the phrase "semantic web" but not "ontology" or "linked data":

[https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?search="semantic web" AND NOT (ontology OR "linked data")](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts?search=%22semantic%20web%22%20AND%20NOT%20\(ontology%20OR%20%22linked%20data%22\))
