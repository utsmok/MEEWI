This is a guide on how to retrieve detailed information on a single entity using the OpenAIRE Graph API.

## Endpoints[​](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/getting-a-single-entity/#endpoints "Direct link to heading")

Currently, the Graph API supports the following entity types:

- Research products - endpoint: `GET /researchProducts/{id}`
- Organizations - endpoint: `GET /organizations/{id}`
- Data sources - endpoint: `GET /dataSources/{id}`
- Projects - endpoint: `GET /projects/{id}`

You can retrieve the data of a single entity by providing the entity's OpenAIRE identifier (id) in the corresponding endpoint. The OpenAIRE id is the primary key of an entity in the OpenAIRE Graph.

note

Note that if you want to retrieve multiple entities based on their OpenAIRE ids, you can use the [search endpoints and filter](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/filtering-search-results#or-operator) by the `id` field using `OR`.

## Response[​](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/getting-a-single-entity/#response "Direct link to heading")

The response of the Graph API is a [Research product](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/data-model/entities/research-product), [Organization](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/data-model/entities/organization), [Data Source](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/data-model/entities/data-source), or [Project](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/data-model/entities/project), depending on the endpoint used.

## Example[​](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/getting-a-single-entity/#example "Direct link to heading")

In order to retrieve the research product with OpenAIRE id: `doi_dedup___::2b3cb7130c506d1c3a05e9160b2c4108`, you have to perform the following API call:

[https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts/doi\_dedup\_\_\_::a55b42c0d32a4a24cf99e621623d110e](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts/doi_dedup___::a55b42c0d32a4a24cf99e621623d110e)

This will return all the data of the research product with the provided identifier:

```

title: "Searching entities | OpenAIRE Graph Documentation"

This is a guide on how to search for specific entities using the OpenAIRE Graph API.

## Endpoints[​](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/#endpoints "Direct link to heading")

Currently, the Graph API supports the following entity types:

- Research products - endpoint: [`GET /researchProducts`](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/researchProducts)
- Organizations - endpoint: [`GET /organizations`](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/organizations)
- Data sources - endpoint: [`GET /dataSources`](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/dataSources)
- Projects - endpoint: [`GET /projects`](https://api.openaire.eu/graph/v1/projects)

Each of these endpoints can be used to list all entities of the corresponding type. Listing such entities can be more useful when using the [filtering](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/filtering-search-results), [sorting](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/sorting-and-paging#sorting), and [paging](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/sorting-and-paging#paging) capabilities of the Graph API.

## Response[​](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/#response "Direct link to heading")

The response of the aforementioned endpoints is an object of the following type:

```
{    header: {        numFound: 36818386,        maxScore: 1,        queryTime: 21,        page: 1,        pageSize: 10    },    results: [        ...    ]}
```

It contains a `header` object with the following fields:

- `numFound`: the total number of entities found
- `maxScore`: the maximum relevance score of the search results
- `queryTime`: the time in milliseconds that the search took
- `page`: the current page of the search results (when using basic pagination)
- `pageSize`: the number of entities per page
- `nextCursor`: the next page cursor (when using cursor-based pagination, see: [paging](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/apis/graph-api/searching-entities/sorting-and-paging#paging)

Finally, the `results` field contains an array of entities of the corresponding type (i.e., [Research product](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/data-model/entities/research-product), [Organization](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/data-model/entities/organization), [Data Source](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/data-model/entities/data-source), or [Project](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/data-model/entities/project)).
