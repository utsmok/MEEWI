To address this, we propose novel, strengthening inequalities, derived from the single-machine scheduling polyhedron augmented by a makespan variable. While the associated optimization problem for a single machine is trivial, these inequalities can be applied as cutting planes to more complicated scheduling problems. In this work, we demonstrate their use for non-permutation flow shops. Using the Taillard benchmark set, we analyze the effect of the inequalities on the linear programming relaxations and mixed-integer programs of three commonly used MIP models. The experiments show that the inequalities significantly improve the ability of linear-ordering and time-indexed models to bound the optimum. The positive effect also extends to linear-ordering models with changeover times, demonstrating the potential of these inequalities to improve more general, application-oriented flow shop problems.","2025-05","2025-03-07 13:14:24","2025-03-07 13:26:55","2025-03-07 13:26:55","106970","","","177","","Computers & Operations Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: a322f9dffdc14f8080d06704573362ae Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","UT-Hybrid-D; Flow shops; Makespan minimization; Mixed-integer programming; Scheduling polytope","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using this framework, we propose a novel and robust mechanism for cooperation based on risk aversion that leads to cooperative behaviour in population games.

Among various AI algorithms, the Fair Representation Learning (FRL) approach has gained significant interest in recent years. However, existing FRL algorithms have a limitation: they are primarily designed for categorical sensitive attributes and thus cannot be applied to continuous sensitive attributes, such as age or income. In this paper, we propose an FRL algorithm for continuous sensitive attributes. First, we introduce a measure called the Expectation of Integral Probability Metrics (EIPM) to assess the fairness level of representation space for continuous sensitive attributes. We demonstrate that if the distribution of the representation has a low EIPM value, then any prediction head constructed on the top of the representation become fair, regardless of the selection of the prediction head. Furthermore, EIPM possesses a distinguished advantage in that it can be accurately estimated using our proposed estimator with finite samples. Based on these properties, we propose a new FRL algorithm called Fair Representation using EIPM with MMD (FREM). Experimental evidences show that FREM outperforms other baseline methods.","2025","2025-03-07 13:14:24","2025-03-07 13:26:26","2025-03-07 13:26:26","1-12","","","","","IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach.

The non-linear alternating current (AC) power flow equations that model different physical laws (together with operational constraints) lay the foundation for the feasibility region of the OPF problem. While significant research has focused on convex relaxations, which are approaches to solve an OPF problem by enlarging the true feasibility region, the opposite approach of convex restrictions offers valuable insights as well. Convex restrictions, including polyhedral restrictions, reduce the true feasible region to a convex region, ensuring that it contains only feasible points. In this work, we develop a sequential optimization method that offers a scalable way to obtain (bounds on) solutions to OPF problems for distribution networks. To do so, we first develop sufficient conditions for the existence of feasible power flow solutions in the neighborhood of a specific (feasible) operating point in distribution networks, and second, based on these conditions, we construct a polyhedral restriction of the feasibility region. Our numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the sequential optimization method as an alternative to existing approaches to obtain (bounds on) solutions to OPF problems for distribution networks. By construction, the optimization problems within the defined restrictions can be solved in polynomial time and are guaranteed to have feasible solutions.","2025","2025-03-07 13:14:25","2025-03-07 13:26:08","2025-03-07 13:26:08","1-12","","","","","IEEE Trans.

Typically, the level of group fairness is measured by the statistical gap between predictions from different protected groups. In this study, we reveal an implicit property of existing group fairness measures, which provides an insight into how the group-fair models behave. Then, we develop a new group-fair constraint based on this implicit property to learn group-fair models. To do so, we first introduce a notable theoretical observation: every group-fair model has an implicitly corresponding transport map between the input spaces of each protected group. Based on this observation, we introduce a new group fairness measure termed Matched Demographic Parity (MDP), which quantifies the averaged gap between predictions of two individuals (from different protected groups) matched by a given transport map. Then, we prove that any transport map can be used in MDP to learn group-fair models, and develop a novel algorithm called Fairness Through Matching (FTM)1, which learns a group-fair model using MDP constraint with an user-specified transport map.We specifically propose two favorable types of transport maps for MDP, based on the optimal transport theory, and discuss their advantages. Experiments reveal that FTM successfully trains group-fair models with certain desirable properties by choosing the transport map accordingly.","2025-01","2025-03-07 13:14:25","2025-03-07 13:18:14","","","","","","","Trans.

In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by analysing the rate of the excess risk of a CNN classifier trained by cross-entropy loss.

An exception is a recent simulation study showing that polarization is persistent when agents form their opinions using social reinforcement learning. Our goal is to highlight the usefulness of reinforcement learning in the context of modeling opinion dynamics, but that caution is required when selecting the tools used to study such a model. We show that the polarization observed in the model of the simulation study cannot persist indefinitely, and exhibits consensus asymptotically with probability one. By constructing a link between the reinforcement learning model and the voter model, we argue that the observed polarization is metastable. Finally, we show that a slight modification in the learning process of the agents changes the model from being non-ergodic to being ergodic. Our results show that reinforcement learning may be a powerful method for modelling polarization in opinion dynamics, but that the tools (objects to study such as the stationary distribution, or time to absorption for example) appropriate for analysing such models crucially depend on their properties (such as ergodicity, or transience). These properties are determined by the details of the learning process and may be difficult to identify based solely on simulations.","2024-12-17","2025-03-07 13:14:25","2025-03-07 13:26:35","2025-03-07 13:26:35","e0313951","","12","19","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: a5ab427022224653941d9b136031d860 Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","","","Ott, William","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When maximizing total shareable costs, the cost shares must satisfy all constraints that define the core of a TU game, except for being budget balanced. The article first gives a fairly complete picture of the computational complexity of this optimization problem, its relation to optimization over the core itself, and its equivalence to other, minimal core relaxations that have been proposed earlier. We then address minimum cost spanning tree (MST) games as an example for a class of cost sharing games with non‐empty core. While submodular cost functions yield efficient algorithms to maximize shareable costs, MST games have cost functions that are subadditive, but generally not submodular. Nevertheless, it is well known that cost shares in the core of MST games can be found efficiently. In contrast, we show that the maximization of shareable costs is ‐hard for MST games and derive a 2‐approximation algorithm.

This comes from the fact that these graphs have a power-law degree distribution, which leads to a dense subgraph in which we find many maximal cliques. These lower bounds seem to contradict previous empirical evidence that (G)IRGs have only few maximal cliques.

Even though these might not be true, we base our estimator on the assumptions that the data are i.i.d. and the conditional distributions of Yi given Wi=wi belong to a one parameter exponential family Q¯ with parameter space given by an interval I. More precisely, we pretend that these conditional distributions take the form Qθ(wi)∈Q¯ for some θ that belongs to a VC-class Θ¯ of functions with values in I. For each i∈1,…,n, we estimate Qi⋆(wi) by a distribution of the same form, i.e. Qθ̂(wi)∈Q¯, where θ̂=θ̂(X1,…,Xn) is a well-chosen estimator with values in Θ¯. We establish non-asymptotic exponential inequalities for the upper deviations of a Hellinger-type distance between the true conditional distributions of the data and the estimated one based on the exponential family Q¯ and the class of functions Θ¯ we chose.

Finally, we provide an algorithm for calculating θ̂ when Θ¯ is a VC-class of functions of low or moderate dimension and we carry out a simulation study to compare its performance to that of the MLE and median-based estimators.

While several existing theoretically justified methods are geared towards robustness against identical heavy-tailed noise distributions, the rise of adversarial attacks has emphasized the importance of safeguarding estimation procedures against systematic contamination. We approach this statistical issue by shifting our focus towards estimating conditional distributions. To address it robustly, we introduce a novel estimation procedure based on ℓ-estimation. Under a mild model assumption, we establish general non-asymptotic risk bounds for the resulting estimators, showcasing their robustness against contamination, outliers, and model misspecification. We then delve into the application of our approach using deep ReLU neural networks. When the model is well-specified and the regression function belongs to an α-Hölder class, employing ℓ-type estimation on suitable networks enables the resulting estimators to achieve the minimax optimal rate of convergence. Additionally, we demonstrate that deep ℓ-type estimators can circumvent the curse of dimensionality by assuming the regression function closely resembles the composition of several Hölder functions. To attain this, new deep fully-connected ReLU neural networks have been designed to approximate this composition class.

Numerous strategies have been proposed to tackle this task, with classification-based methods, specifically those utilizing a self-supervised approach via random affine transformations (RATs), demonstrating remarkable performance on both image and non-image data. However, these methods encounter a notable bottleneck, the overlap of constructed labeled datasets across categories, which hampers the subsequent classifiers’ ability to detect anomalies. Consequently, the creation of an effective data distribution becomes the pivotal factor for success. In this article, we introduce a model called “self-supervised forest (sForest)”, which leverages the random Fourier transform (RFT) and random orthogonal rotations to craft a controlled data distribution. Our model utilizes the RFT to map input data into a new feature space. With this transformed data, we create a self-labeled training dataset using random orthogonal rotations. We theoretically prove that the data distribution formulated by our methodology is more stable compared to one derived from RATs. We then use the self-labeled dataset in a random forest (RF) classifier to distinguish between normal and anomalous data points. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both real and artificial datasets illustrate that sForest outperforms other anomaly detection methods, including distance-based, kernel-based, forest-based, and network-based benchmarks.","2025-02","2025-03-07 13:14:25","2025-03-07 13:26:28","2025-03-07 13:26:28","2675-2689","","2","36","","IEEE Trans.

This flexible modeling framework generalizes mixed effects survival models by allowing positive and negative associations among clustered observations. Conjugate shifted-inverse gamma priors are proposed for the covariance parameters, implying inverse gamma priors for the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, which ensures a positive definite covariance matrix under posterior analysis. A numerically efficient Gibbs sampling procedure is defined for balanced nested designs. This requires sampling latent variables from their marginal full conditional distributions, which are derived through a recursive formula. This makes the estimation procedure suitable for interval-censored data with large cluster sizes. For unbalanced nested designs, a novel (balancing) data augmentation procedure is introduced to improve the efficiency of the Gibbs sampler. The Gibbs sampling procedure is validated in two simulation studies. The linear transformation BCSM (LT-BCSM) was applied to two-way nested interval-censored event times to analyze differences in adverse events between three groups of patients, who were randomly allocated to treatment with different stents (BIO-RESORT). The parameters of the structured covariance matrix represented unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects and were examined to detect differential treatment effects. A comparison was made with inference results under a random effects linear transformation model. It was concluded that the LT-BCSM led to inferences with higher posterior credibility, a more profound way of quantifying evidence for risk equivalence of the three treatments, and it was more robust to prior specifications.","2024-11","2025-03-07 13:14:25","2025-03-07 13:25:56","2025-03-07 13:25:56","105359","","","204","","Journal of Multivariate Analysis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: 0270f3a6a6c8421ea8d3f35ab52e4840 Publisher: Academic Press Inc.","","","","UT-Hybrid-D; Covariance structure model; Interval-censored times; Linear transformation model; Multi-way nested design; Shifted-inverse gamma distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper introduces an innovative mathematical programming model for the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) with dynamic security constraints (DSCs), considering two scenarios: the islanded operation and the transition. This model uses positive-sequence equations to represent the inverter-based resources (IBRs) for grid-forming and grid-following roles, along with a fourth-order synchronous generator model equipped with excitation and frequency control systems. They assess the dynamic response to specific events such as short-circuits, decreases in PV generation, increases in load demand during the islanded operation, and the transition itself. The DSCs are applied to dispatchable distributed energy resources (DERs), which react to variations in the microgrid, considering generation and opportunity costs to minimize the discrepancy between planned and secure operating points. The mathematical programming model is implemented using AMPL, and solutions are obtained through the nonlinear optimization solver IPOPT. The tests are conducted in an adapted version of the microgrid being developed at the University of Campinas that includes a synchronous generator, photovoltaic (PV) generation, and a battery energy storage system (BESS).

Addressing these issues, this paper presents a novel tri-level adaptive robust optimization model for EV charging coordination, explicitly considering active and reactive power control (RPC) and its impact on the distribution network. The first level optimizes the operation of unbalanced three-phase AC distribution systems through economic dispatch of distributed generation (DG) units, modeled using mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). The second level minimizes the energy non-supplied (ENS) to EVs during charging, considering both grid constraints and DG dispatches. The third level introduces an adaptive robust approach to handle uncertainties related to demand, renewable energy generation, and EV initial states of charge. This tri-level model, formulated as a min-max-min optimization, is solved using the column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) method.

Our theoretical contributions are the proof that random polynomials almost surely have a high linearization complexity and characterizations of its value in case we do or do not restrict the set of admissible Boolean functions.

A shared-memory switch consists of an input port, a number of output ports, and a buffer with a specific capacity. In each time step, an arbitrary number of packets arrive at the input port, each packet designated for one output port. Each packet is added to the queue of the respective output port. If the total number of packets exceeds the capacity of the buffer, some packets have to be irrevocably evicted. At the end of each time step, each output port transmits a packet in its queue, and the goal is to maximize the number of transmitted packets.

In order to identify plausible stochastic models, quantitative comparisons between the models and the experimental data are required. The data for these systems have small sample sizes and time-evolving distributions. The aim of this study is to identify appropriate distance metrics for the quantitative comparison of stochastic model outputs and time-evolving stochastic measurements of a system. We identify distance metrics with features suitable for driving parameter inference, model comparison, and model validation, constrained by data from multiple experimental protocols. In this study, stochastic model outputs are compared to synthetic data across three scales: that of the data at the points the system is sampled during the time course of each type of experiment; a combined distance across the time course of each experiment; and a combined distance across all the experiments. Two broad categories of comparators at each point were considered, based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the data and of the model outputs: discrete based measures such as the Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance, and integrated measures such as the Wasserstein-1 distance between the ECDFs. It was found that the discrete based measures were highly sensitive to parameter changes near the synthetic data parameters, but were largely insensitive otherwise, whereas the integrated distances had smoother transitions as the parameters approached the true values. The integrated measures were also found to be robust to noise added to the synthetic data, replicating experimental error. The characteristics of the identified distances provides the basis for the design of an algorithm suitable for fitting stochastic models to real world stochastic data.","2024-09","2025-03-07 13:14:25","2025-03-07 13:26:44","2025-03-07 13:26:44","111","","9","86","","Bull Math Biol","The Distance Between","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: 46d9a2d628af491f996d98ad81875ef9 Publisher: Springer","","","","Distance between evolving distributions; Distance metrics; Multiple experiments; Time-series data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To find a robust forecasting model, feature selection is employed to select the most relevant input features, and additionally, hyperparameter optimization is performed using the Chu–Beasley genetic algorithm to automatically set the hyperparameters for each technique. An initial day-ahead PPF is computed recursively after selecting the optimal forecasting model. Subsequently, this initial forecast is refined using a long-short-term memory autoencoder (LSTM-AE) that corrects the initial PPF. To further enhance the interpretability of the final forecast, the k-means algorithm, incorporating a soft-dynamic time warping (DTW) metric, is utilized.

We develop a non-parametric adaptive kernel smoothing technique to estimate the spatio-temporal hazard map and to interpolate monthly well-based gas production statistics. Second- and higher-order inhomogeneous summary statistics are used to show that the state-of-the-art rate-and-state models for the prediction of seismic hazard fail to capture inter-event interaction in the earthquake catalogue. Based on these findings, we suggest a modified rate-and-state model that also takes into account changes in gas production volumes and uncertainty in the pore pressure field.","2024-08","2025-03-07 13:14:25","2025-03-07 13:26:53","2025-03-07 13:26:53","1185-1206","","6","56","","Math Geosci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: 256a280cd6f74a0f8ee28db418c04421 Publisher: Springer Netherlands","","","","UT-Hybrid-D; Adaptive bandwidth selection; Induced seismicity; Inhomogeneous summary statistics; Kernel smoothing; Pore pressure; Spatio-temporal point processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To derive bounds for the performance of the estimator under covariate shift, however, pointwise convergence rates are required. Under weak assumptions on the design distribution, it is shown that least squares estimators (LSE) over 1-Lipschitz functions are also minimax rate optimal with respect to a weighted uniform norm, where the weighting accounts in a natural way for the non-uniformity of the design distribution. This implies that although least squares is a global criterion, the LSE adapts locally to the size of the design density. We develop a new indirect proof technique that establishes the local convergence behavior based on a carefully chosen local perturbation of the LSE. The obtained local rates are then applied to analyze the LSE for transfer learning under covariate shift.","2024-08-01","2025-03-07 13:14:25","2025-03-07 13:26:42","2025-03-07 13:26:42","1845–1877","","3","30","","Bernoulli","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: 04ff65468e774feba063df563e307b1c Publisher: Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed method utilizes a stochastic profile steering algorithm as a greedy heuristic. The optimization process considers random parameters such as local forecasted demand, photovoltaic (PV) production, and the initial energy of electric vehicles (EVs) as embedded scenarios. Profile steering coordinates the flexible electricity assets within an energy community by determining the contribution of each prosumer's profile to the average value of the objective function. It iteratively selects the prosumer that contributes the most until no further improvements can be made. This process scales linearly with the number of controllable prosumers and can achieve various community-level objectives, such as maximizing self-sufficiency or minimizing aggregated cost-of-energy, even when dealing with non-convex optimization problems for modeling each prosumer's local energy management system. The outcome of the proposed method optimizes the average value of the community's objective while ensuring that grid limitations are met within a specified probability. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations involving small-scale communities (5 households) and large-scale communities (100 households). The results demonstrate the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of the proposed method, as well as its ability to reschedule the aggregated demand to ensure that grid limits are not violated with at least a 95","2024-07","2025-03-07 13:14:25","2025-03-07 13:26:29","2025-03-07 13:26:29","109973","","","158","","International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: c42e0989754e4d5f9aeecf05139988e0 Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","UT-Hybrid-D; Distributed energy management system; Energy communities; Flexible energy assets; Probabilistic grid limits; Stochastic profile steering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, in order to perform efficient statistical inference, one must obtain high-quality estimates of the corresponding likelihood. Our findings indicate that the crude Monte Carlo method, which is the de facto state-of-the-art method, is not adequate in practice for efficient likelihood estimation. To cope with this problem, we propose to employ the sequential Monte Carlo approach, which shows promise for improved reliability compared to the current state of the art.

Motivated by this, this work aims to model and integrate human preferences into a HEMS, bridging the gap between end-participant and LEM. A sensitivity analysis of the parameter choices of the HEMS and their impact on the performance and outcomes of a LEM is done. Hereby, a behavior model is used to formulate the preferences and motives of households within a LEM in a bottom-up approach. Various distributed energy resources are modeled and controlled via a HEMS, allowing households to input their preferences and motives to output a tailor-made bidcurve for the LEM. A sensitivity analysis reveals that different preference settings result in different consumption profiles, which to a large extent align with the preferences. In addition, the importance of aligning market mechanisms and steering signals with the participants' goals is highlighted.","2024-06","2025-03-07 13:14:25","2025-03-07 13:26:20","2025-03-07 13:26:20","265-275","","2","2","","IEEE Trans. on Enrgy Mrkts, Pol and Reg","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: 8852463c9ae643e8837acf30773cdc83 Publisher: IEEE","","","","Mathematical models; Behavioral sciences; Biological system modeling; Context modeling; Electricity; Electricity supply industry; Energy conservation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Component production capacity is subject to fluctuations, causing a high risk of shortages of at least one component, which results in costly delays. Companies hedge this risk by strategic investments in excess production capacity and in buffer inventories of components. To optimize these, it is crucial to characterize the relation between component shortage risk and capacity and inventory investments. We suppose that component production capacity and produce demand are normally distributed over finite time intervals, and we accordingly model the production system as a symmetric fork-join queueing network with N statistically identical queues with a common arrival process and independent service processes. Assuming a symmetric cost structure, we subsequently apply extreme value theory to gain analytic insights into this optimization problem. We derive several new results for this queueing network, notably that the scaled maximum of N steady-state queue lengths converges in distribution to a Gaussian random variable. These results translate into asymptotically optimal methods to dimension the system. Tests on a range of problems reveal that these methods typically work well for systems of moderate size.

In this work, we present a consecutive algorithm for super-resolution (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) scanning microscopy that provides molecule counts in automatically generated image segments and offers statistical guarantees in form of asymptotic confidence intervals. To this end, we first apply a multiscale scanning procedure on STED microscopy measurements of the sample to obtain a system of significant regions, each of which contains at least one molecule with prescribed uniform probability. This system of regions will typically be highly redundant and consists of rectangular building blocks. To choose an informative but non-redundant subset of more naturally shaped regions, we hybridize our system with the result of a generic segmentation algorithm. The diameter of the segments can be of the order of the resolution of the microscope. Using multiple photon coincidence measurements of the same sample in confocal mode, we are then able to estimate the brightness and number of molecules and give uniform confidence intervals on the molecule counts for each previously constructed segment. In other words, we establish a so-called molecular map with uniform error control.

Therefore, it is important to quantify the resilience of existing cellular network infrastructures against potential risks, ranging from natural disasters to security attacks, that might occur with a low probability but can lead to severe disruption of the services. In this paper, we combine models with public data from national bodies on mobile network opera-tor (MNO) infrastructures, population distribution, and urbanity level to assess the coverage and capacity of a cellular network at a country scale. Our analysis offers insights on the potential weak points that need improvement to ensure a low fraction of disconnected population (FDP) and high fraction of satisfied population (FSP). As a resilience improvement approach, we investigate in which regions and to what extent each MNO can benefit from infrastructure sharing or national roaming, i.e., all MNOs act as a single national operator. As our case study, we focus on Dutch cellular infrastructure and model risks as random failures and correlated failures in a geographic region.

We introduce the robust local differential privacy (RLDP) framework, which provides strong privacy guarantees, while preserving utility. This is achieved by providing robust privacy: our mechanisms do not only provide privacy with respect to a publicly available estimate of the unknown true distribution, but also with respect to similar distributions. Such robustness mitigates the potential privacy leaks that might arise from the difference between the true distribution and the estimated one. At the same time, we mitigate the utility penalties that come with ordinary differential privacy, which involves making worst-case assumptions and dealing with extreme cases. We achieve robustness in privacy by constructing an uncertainty set based on a Rényi divergence. By analyzing the structure of this set and approximating it with a polytope, we can use robust optimization to find mechanisms with high utility. However, this relies on vertex enumeration and becomes computationally inaccessible for large input spaces. Therefore, we also introduce two low-complexity algorithms that build on existing LDP mechanisms. We evaluate the utility and robustness of the mechanisms using numerical experiments and demonstrate that our mechanisms provide robust privacy, while achieving a utility that is close to optimal.","2024-03-06","2025-03-07 13:14:26","2025-03-07 13:26:30","2025-03-07 13:26:30","233","","3","26","","Entropy","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: 49fc6831815145fe8811e015719f9cf7 Publisher: MDPI","","","","Local differential privacy; R{\'e}nyi divergence; Robust optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We therefore use stochastic geometry to investigate the effect of co-location on the benefits of resource sharing. We develop an intricate relation between the co-location factor and the optimal radius to operate the network, which shows that indeed co-location is an important factor to take into account.

This leads to a needed change in the traditional energy system, in which decentralized local energy resources must be better integrated. In order to face the challenges for a future energy management, the consideration of the domestic level is gaining more attention. In this paper, we aim to get insights into the potential value of local cooperations and focus on economic and control issues as to whether and how the domestic level can participate in upcoming solutions. We introduce a possible setup for a virtual economic unit representing a hybrid cooperation of domestic energy participants, whereby the objective of this cooperation is to realize the maximum possible savings for the community with specified individual contracts between the participants and assuming that participants continue to have additional contracts with their energy service provider. We propose a deterministic linear optimization model for determining optimal energy load profiles of the participants with the external suppliers and energy exchange between participants in a virtual economic unit. To efficiently solve this model and get an exact assignment of supply and demand, we present a maximum saving flow algorithm taking into account the underlying bipartite structure of this problem. The solution achieved is specified as a peer-to-peer allocation between the participants involved and provides insights into the aspects that determine the concrete assignment. It also has the advantage of leading to a robust solution within the collaboration case studies for a basic set-up demonstrate the impact of this approach on the economic potential of aggregating local generation and demand at the same time.","2024-01","2025-03-07 13:14:26","2025-03-07 13:26:19","2025-03-07 13:26:19","107252","","","129","","Energy Economics","Local energy management","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: 6221619f9004454680b8a47b5d4ddb65 Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","2024 OA procedure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, inherent noise is not a necessary evil of the iterative learning process. It is a critical asset for the learning of cooperation.

Worst-case analysis often falls short of explaining this performance. Because of this, “beyond worst-case analysis” of algorithms has recently gained a lot of attention, including probabilistic analysis of algorithms. The instances of many (combinatorial) optimization problems are essentially a discrete metric space. Probabilistic analysis for such metric optimization problems has nevertheless mostly been conducted on instances drawn from Euclidean space, which provides a structure that is usually heavily exploited in the analysis. However, most instances from practice are not Euclidean. Little work has been done on metric instances drawn from other, more realistic, distributions. Some initial results have been obtained in recent years, where random shortest path metrics generated from dense graphs (either complete graphs or Erdős–Rényi random graphs) have been used so far. In this paper we extend these findings to sparse graphs, with a focus on sparse graphs with ‘fast growing cut sizes’, i.e. graphs for which                                                   $$|\delta (U)|=\Omega (|U|^\varepsilon )$$                                                               |                       δ                                                (                         U                         )                                              |                       =                       Ω                       (                       |                       U                                                |                         ε                                              )                                                                                       for some constant                                                   $$\varepsilon \in (0,1)$$                                                               ε                       ∈                       (                       0                       ,                       1                       )                                                                                       for all subsets               U               of the vertices, where                                                   $$\delta (U)$$                                                               δ                       (                       U                       )                                                                                       is the set of edges connecting               U               to the remaining vertices. A random shortest path metric is constructed by drawing independent random edge weights for each edge in the graph and setting the distance between every pair of vertices to the length of a shortest path between them with respect to the drawn weights. For such instances generated from a sparse graph with fast growing cut sizes, we prove that the greedy heuristic for the minimum distance maximum matching problem, and the nearest neighbor and insertion heuristics for the traveling salesman problem all achieve a constant expected approximation ratio. Additionally, for instances generated from an arbitrary sparse graph, we show that the 2-opt heuristic for the traveling salesman problem also achieves a constant expected approximation ratio.","2023-12","2025-03-07 13:14:26","2025-03-07 13:26:24","2025-03-07 13:26:24","3793-3815","","12","85","","Algorithmica","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: 0d6ebe36903e43bfa313cf2ef3096593 Publisher: Springer New York","","","","UT-Hybrid-D; Approximation algorithms; Average-case analysis; First-passage percolation; Probabilistic analysis; Random shortest path metrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Upon service completion at a FIFO queue, a job splits (forks) into two parts: the first part is routed to the next node on its route, and the second part is placed in the incubation queue. Routing of the jobs of multiple types is governed by a central decision maker that decides on the routes for each job type and aims to minimize the mean turnaround time of the jobs, i.e., the time spent in the system until service completion at the FIFO queue in the last node, and at all incubation queues on the job's route, which may be viewed as a join operation. We provide explicit results for the turnaround time when all service and inter-arrival time distributions are exponential and invoke the Queueing Network Analyzer when these distributions are general.

As a result, LLP is a typical weakly supervised learning protocol and commonly exists in privacy protection circumstances due to the sensitivity in label information for real-world applications. In general, it is less laborious and more efficient to collect label proportions as the bag-level supervised information than the instance-level one. However, the hint for learning the discriminative feature representation is also limited as a less informative signal directly associated with the labels is provided, thus deteriorating the performance of the final instance-level classifier. In this article, delving into the label proportions, we bypass this weak supervision by leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) to derive an effective algorithm LLP-GAN. Endowed with an end-to-end structure, LLP-GAN performs approximation in the light of an adversarial learning mechanism without imposing restricted assumptions on distribution. Accordingly, the final instance-level classifier can be directly induced upon the discriminator with minor modification. Under mild assumptions, we give the explicit generative representation and prove the global optimality for LLP-GAN. In addition, compared with existing methods, our work empowers LLP solvers with desirable scalability inheriting from deep models.

However, these methods have some restrictions, such as the high computational cost, the reliance on a centralized computer system, and the lack of data privacy. To overcome these limitations, decentralized optimization methods have been proposed in recent years. Decentralized methods divide the control variables of the centralized optimization problem over several controllers, and each controller solves its own subproblem independently. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization framework for managing the operation of distribution systems. The primary objective of the proposed method is to optimize the tap positions of voltage regulators and charging and discharging powers for energy storage devices locally through a decentralized coordination process. The used objective functions take into account the voltage profile within the network, the lifetime of the devices, and the energy losses in the systems. Two decentralized methods, based on the Advanced Arithmetic Optimizer algorithm and the Profile Steering approach, are proposed to address the limitations of centralized optimization methods. The decentralized methods aim to improve the reliability and efficiency of the optimization process, while also minimizing communication and computational costs. The proposed methods are evaluated and compared to a centralized approach using the IEEE 33 and 69 bus systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed decentralized methods can effectively resolve voltage problems, minimize energy losses, and find high-quality solutions with improved computational efficiency compared to the centralized approach.","2023-11","2025-03-07 13:14:26","2025-03-07 13:25:51","2025-03-07 13:25:51","109330","","","153","","International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: a7d40d72f5d2498dbd5db51626979709 Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","Linear programming; UT-Gold-D; Power system planning; Distribution networks; Electrostatic discharges; Energy resolution; Photovoltaic systems; Regulators; Simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these challenges, smart charging approaches have emerged as a key solution that optimizes charging processes and contributes to a smarter and more efficient grid. This paper presents an innovative multi-objective optimization framework for EV smart charging (EVSC) using the Dynamic Hunting Leadership (DHL) method. The framework aims to improve the voltage profile of the system in addition to eliminating voltage violations and energy not supplied (ENS) to EVs within the network. The proposed approach considers both residential EV chargers and parking stations, incorporating realistic EV charger behaviors based on constant current charging and addressing the problem as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. The performance of the optimization method is evaluated on a distribution network with varying levels of EV penetration connected to the chargers in the grid. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DHL algorithm in minimizing conflicting objectives and improving the grid’s voltage profile while considering operational constraints. This study provides a road map for EV aggregators and EV owners, guiding them on how to charge EVs based on preferences while minimizing adverse technical impacts on the grid.","2023-10-05","2025-03-07 13:14:26","2025-03-07 13:25:52","2025-03-07 13:25:52","6959","","19","16","","Energies","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: e3d6b20d957c476f9827fa81867861f2 Publisher: MDPI","","","","Smart grid; Charging strategy; DSistribution network; Electric vehicle; Optimization algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The phase coherence of the neurons is plastic and driven by the duration of daylight. With aging, the capacity to behaviorally adapt to seasonal changes in photoperiod reduces. The mechanisms underlying photoperiodic adaptation are largely unknown, but are important to unravel for the development of novel interventions to improve the quality of life of the elderly. We analyzed the phase coherence of single-cell PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) expression rhythms in the SCN of young and old mice entrained to either long or short photoperiod. The phase coherence was used as input to a 2-community noisy Kuramoto model to estimate the coupling strength between and within neuronal subpopulations. The model revealed a correlation between coupling strength and photoperiod-induced changes in the phase relationship among neurons, suggesting a functional link. We found that the SCN of young mice adapts in coupling strength over a large range, with weak coupling in long photoperiod (LP) and strong coupling in short photoperiod (SP). In aged mice, we also found weak coupling in LP, but a reduced capacity to reach strong coupling in SP. The inability to respond with an increase in coupling strength suggests that manipulation of photoperiod is not a suitable strategy to enhance clock function with aging. We conclude that the inability of aged mice to reach strong coupling contributes to deficits in behavioral adaptation to seasonal changes in photoperiod.","2023-10","2025-03-07 13:14:26","2025-03-07 13:26:50","2025-03-07 13:26:50","461-475","","5","38","","J Biol Rhythms","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: c883682caf3b40c1aa38a3133af0ca78 Publisher: Sage","","","","Aging; Circadian rhythm; Coupling strength; Kuramoto model; PERIOD 2; Seasonal adaptation; Suprachiasmatic nucleus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current APC techniques result in excessive and unfair power curtailment for prosumers at the sensitive parts of the grid that might induce neutral current. In this work, an analytical approach for fair APC and Reactive Power Control is presented for voltage regulation along with neutral current compensation. The desired power quality is maintained by controlling each phase of the PV inverter independently. The proposed algorithm regulates the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) within grid limits, eliminates neutral current, and reduces the grid unbalance.

Wepropose a general strategy to obtain lower bounds on the variance of any estimatorwith bias smaller than a prespecified bound. This shows to whichextent the bias-variance trade-off is unavoidable and allows to quantify theloss of performance for methods that do not obey it. The approach is basedon a number of abstract lower bounds for the variance involving the changeof expectation with respect to different probability measures as well as informationmeasures such as the Kullback–Leibler or χ2-divergence. Some ofthese inequalities rely on a new concept of information matrices. In a secondpart of the article, the abstract lower bounds are applied to several statisticalmodels including the Gaussian white noise model, a boundary estimationproblem, the Gaussian sequence model and the high-dimensional linear regressionmodel. For these specific statistical applications, different types ofbias-variance trade-offs occur that vary considerably in their strength. Forthe trade-off between integrated squared bias and integrated variance in theGaussian white noise model, we propose to combine the general strategy forlower bounds with a reduction technique. This allows us to reduce the originalproblem to a lower bound on the bias-variance trade-off for estimators withadditional symmetry properties in a simpler statistical model.

The AC SOPF considers discrete utility functions from charging pools as a compensation mechanism for eventual energy not served to their charging tasks. An application of the AC SOPF is described where a distribution system operator (DSO) requires flexibility to each charging pool in a day-ahead time frame, minimizing the cost for flexibility while guaranteeing technical limits. Flexibility areas are defined for each charging pool and calculated as a function of a risk parameter involving the uncertainty of the solution.

To tackle these problems, we construct reduced basis/multiscale ansatz functions defined in space that can be combined with time stepping schemes within model order reduction or multiscale methods. To that end, we propose to perform several simulations of the PDE for a few time steps in parallel starting at different, randomly drawn start points, prescribing random initial conditions; applying a singular value decomposition to a subset of the so obtained snapshots yields the reduced basis/multiscale ansatz functions. This facilitates constructing the reduced basis/multiscale ansatz functions in an embarrassingly parallel manner. In detail, we suggest using a data-dependent probability distribution based on the data functions of the PDE to select the start points. Each local in time simulation of the PDE with random initial conditions approximates a local approximation space in one time point that is optimal in the sense of Kolmogorov. The derivation of these optimal local approximation spaces which are spanned by the left singular vectors of a compact transfer operator that maps arbitrary initial conditions to the solution of the PDE in a later point of time is one other main contribution of this paper. By solving the PDE locally in time with random initial conditions, we construct local ansatz spaces in time that converge provably at a quasi-optimal rate and allow for local error control. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform existing methods like the proper orthogonal decomposition even in a sequential setting and is well capable of approximating advection-dominated problems.","2023-06-30","2025-03-07 13:14:26","2025-03-07 13:26:42","2025-03-07 13:26:42","A1066-A1096","","3","45","","SIAM J.

How do particular rules of placing random edges result in graphs that share some of the fundamental empirical properties of real-life networks? This article of Nelly Litvak is based on her lectures of PWN Vakantiecursus 2022. Complex networks, modeled as random graphsMany real-life systems are networks. A network is a set of objects connected by some relationship. For example, a railroad is a col-lection of stations connected by rails. In a social network, people are connected by friendships. The Internet is a network of routers connected by wires. In our brain, neurons are connected if they fire together.A graph is a natural mathematical model for a network of any kind. In a graph, each object is represented as a vertex, and if there is a relationship between two vertices, then there is an edge between them. Undirected edges represent symmetric relations, and we draw them as lines. For example, communications between two Internet routers usually go in both directions. If the relation is not symmetric, we model this using directed edges, and draw them as arrows. For example, if somebody follows you on Twitter, you might not follow back. In Figure 1, we give some examples of networks, directed and undirected.This article is about how to mathematically describe real-life networks, such as social networks or the World Wide Web, using so-called random graphs. Usually in research, and always in this article, the vertices of a random graph are fixed, while the edges are placed at random. This makes sense because relationships be-tween objects often emerge at random, like friendships in a social network. Also, even if a network is not random, such as the Inter-net, its structure is so complicated that it is often useful to describe it through statistical summaries and model it as a random object. A random graph model is in fact a set of rules, according to which the random edges are chosen. Different rules result in different models with different mathematical properties. For example, in one model, edges between all vertex pairs can be equally likely, while other models assign higher probabilities to some vertex pairs.In this article, I will tell about several random graph models that are by now well understood, even classical. My goal is to explain how particular rules of placing random edges result in graphs that share some of the fundamental empirical properties of real-life networks. There are many such properties, but I will address four of them, listed in the next section.","2023-06-01","2025-03-07 13:14:26","2025-03-07 13:18:16","","103–113","","24","5","","Nieuw Arch. Wisk.

Considering these promises, a rationale policy for a network operator would be to implement multi-connectivity for all of its users. In this paper, we investigate whether the promises of multi-connectivity also hold in such a setting where all users of a network are connected through multiple links in the downlink. In particular, we consider a wireless network where every user connects to its k closest base stations. Using a framework of stochastic geometry and probability theory, we obtain analytic expressions for per-user throughput and outage probability of k-connectivity networks under several failure models. In contrast to the conclusions of previous research, our analysis shows that per-user throughput always decreases with increasing k. However, multi-connected networks are more resilient against failures than single connected networks as reflected with lower outage probability. Moreover, multi-connectivity leads to higher throughput fairness among the users. Consequently, we conclude that rather than implementing multi-connectivity for all users, a network operator should consider it for the users who would benefit from additional links the most, e.g., cell edge users.","2023-06","2025-03-07 13:14:26","2025-03-07 13:26:58","2025-03-07 13:26:58","7973-7986","","6","72","","IEEE Trans.

The EDO uses a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to ensure the day-ahead dispatch of the distributed energy resources (DERs) in the microgrid while adhering to grid constraints such as voltage, current, and power limits. Additionally, the optimization module takes into account security constraints for unplanned islanded operation, as well as stochastic scenarios of local demand and renewable generation. To assess the performance of the proposed IoT-based EMS, tests are conducted using a real-time simulator in a software-in-the-loop (SIL) experimental setup.

It consists of four variants, each highlighting distinct leadership strategies to guide the hunting process. The development of the algorithm was based on the realization that effective leadership during the hunting process can significantly improve its efficacy. The concept behind these methods is to dynamically modify the number of leaders, which can enhance the algorithm's performance. The stability of DHL variants in exploring the unknown area of the search space and exploitation phases is compared, and the advantages of exploration or exploration ability for the different variants of DHL are discussed. Moreover, the results are compared with more than twenty well-known algorithms. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms in discovering near-optimal solutions is tested across several real-world applications, and the outcomes demonstrate that the DHL algorithm outperforms other competing algorithms. The distinctiveness of the DHL algorithm is its ability to identify the global minimum on various benchmark problems and its superior performance in enhancing the objective value for the welded beam design problem and tension–compression spring problem, surpassing the values achieved by other algorithms. The algorithms’ performance is also tested on an optimal allocation problem of distributed generation (DG) and energy storage system (ESS) for balanced electrical distribution systems.

Intrinsic coordinate stochastic equations on the manifold are sometimes computationally impractical, and numerical projections are therefore useful in many cases. In this paper a combined midpoint projection algorithm is proposed that uses a midpoint projection onto a tangent space, combined with a subsequent normal projection to satisfy the constraints. We also show that the Stratonovich form of stochastic calculus is generally obtained with finite bandwidth noise in the presence of a strong enough external potential that constrains the resulting physical motion to a manifold. Numerical examples are given for a wide range of manifolds, including circular, spheroidal, hyperboloidal, and catenoidal cases, higher-order polynomial constraints that give a quasicubical surface, and a ten-dimensional hypersphere. In all cases the combined midpoint method has greatly reduced errors compared to other methods used for comparison, namely, a combined Euler projection approach and a tangential projection algorithm. We derive intrinsic stochastic equations for spheroidal and hyperboloidal surfaces for comparison purposes to verify the results. Our technique can handle multiple constraints, which allows manifolds that embody several conserved quantities. The algorithm is accurate, simple, and efficient. A reduction of an order of magnitude in the diffusion distance error is found compared to the other methods and an up to several orders of magnitude reduction in constraint function errors.","2023-05-19","2025-03-07 13:14:26","2025-03-07 13:26:23","2025-03-07 13:26:23","055307","","5","107","","Phys.

Our dynamic fair balancing models yield decision rules for patient allocation to hospitals within the region and reallocation across regions based on safety levels and forecast bed surplus or bed shortage for each hospital or region.Input for the model is an accurate real-time forecast of the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the ward and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospitals based on the predicted inflow of patients, their Length of Stay and patient transfer probabilities among ward and ICU. The required data is obtained from the hospitals’ data warehouses and regional infection data as recorded in the Netherlands.The algorithm is evaluated in Dutch regions for allocation of COVID-19 patients to hospitals within the region and reallocation across regions using data from the second COVID-19 peak.","2023-04","2025-03-07 13:14:27","2025-03-07 13:26:15","2025-03-07 13:26:15","102801","","","116","","Omega","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: b9afc48b16df4a9da0229e5c4c70867a Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","COVID-19; Queueing theory; UT-Hybrid-D; Bed occupancy; Load balancing; Patient allocation; Stochastic program","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, this study is devoted to a new multi-objective formulation to maximize the hosting capacity and minimize the total energy losses while satisfying the operational constraints and maximizing the energy transferred to off-peak hours. The Multi-Objective Advanced Gray Wolf Optimization (MOAGWO) algorithm is used as a solution tool. The proposed formulation and solution algorithm are tested on IEEE-33-bus and 69-bus medium voltage test systems. The impacts of energy storage systems, voltage regulators, and static var compensators on the hosting capacity and the objective functions are identified using several scenarios.

The main goal of this study is to coordinate the assignments of radiopharmaceuticals and the scheduling of outpatients on imaging scanners. We study a case of a molecular imaging center that offers services for various diagnostic procedures for outpatient requests. Most procedures in molecular imaging involve several steps limited by strict time windows and require a time-sensitive chemical element, technetium-99m (99mTc) with a limited half-life, to produce the radiopharmaceuticals. We investigate the mathematical dynamics of 99mTc dosages to construct optimal schedules for preparing the radio pharmaceuticals. We develop a rigorous mixed-integer programming model to coordinate the assignment of the radiopharmaceuticals and the scheduling of outpatients on the scanners. The objective is to minimize the total deviation from the scheduled scanning times. We also develop a novel, less conservative robust optimization approach to capture the uncertainty raised by the availability of 99mTc. We propose an uncertainty handling mechanism to reduce the uncertainty interval over time recursively. The proposed mechanism avoids over-conservatism and increases the reliability of mathematical robust models. We evaluate the proposed models by multiple criteria. The final results suggest that the robust model is able to schedule up to 40 outpatients with at most 20 percent of deviation from the scheduled scan times with a decent degree of the constraint violation versus 30 outpatients with at most 50 percent according to the current practice.","2023-03","2025-03-07 13:14:27","2025-03-07 13:26:37","2025-03-07 13:26:37","1018-1031","","3","305","","European Journal of Operational Research","Appointment scheduling for medical diagnostic centers considering time-sensitive pharmaceuticals","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: 82bdd87cf82a4431a3ea7c29b835f120 Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","22/3 OA procedure; Robust optimization; Medical imaging; Mixed integer programming; OR in health services; Scheduling appointment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While most of the existing approaches are developed from the operator's perspective considering EV aggregated demands at the medium-voltage (MV) level, individual users' comfort and the particularities associated with low-voltage (LV) networks need to be considered to holistically assess the EV effects in an integrated MV/LV network. This article proposes a two-level hierarchical optimization framework for the EV charging coordination (EVCC) that maximizes users' satisfaction, while avoiding operational grid issues in the whole distribution system. The framework is tailored for unbalanced distribution systems with high penetration of EVs and introduces a novel index to measure charging priority-based EV user satisfaction. To reduce the computational burden, the EVCC problem is disaggregated into an upper level for MV network operation, and a lower level for LV network and individual EV scheduling, using mixed-integer linear programming models. This framework is later embedded in a dynamic scheduling approach that copes with unexpected EV arrivals. Benefits (increased overall user satisfaction and reduced strain over distribution assets) are demonstrated via case studies in a 459-node three-phase network in which solutions were achieved under a 60-s threshold.","2023-03","2025-03-07 13:14:27","2025-03-07 13:25:57","2025-03-07 13:25:57","1247-1258","","1","17","","IEEE Systems Journal","","","","","","","","en","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/downloads/license-information/IEEE.html","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: 87f3e04061c048f2919e9cad8b01dfde Publisher: IEEE","","","","2023 OA procedure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This abundance of data is often underutilized for improving laboratory efficiency.             Objectives The first aim of this descriptive study is to provide a structured approach for transforming raw laboratory data to data that is suitable for process mining. The second aim is to describe a process mining approach for mapping and characterizing the sample flow in a clinical chemistry laboratory to identify areas for improvement in the testing process.             Methods Data were extracted from instrument log files and the middleware between laboratory instruments and information technology infrastructure. Process mining was used for automated process discovery and analysis. Laboratory performance was quantified in terms of relevant key performance indicators (KPIs): turnaround time, timeliness, workload, work-in-process, and machine downtime.             Results The method was applied to two Dutch university hospital clinical chemistry laboratories. We identified areas where alternative routes might increase laboratory efficiency and observed the negative effects of machine downtime on laboratory performance. This encourages the laboratory to review sample routes in its analyzer lines, the routes of high priority samples during instrument downtime, as well as the preventive maintenance policy.             Conclusion This article provides the first application of process mining to event data from a medical diagnostic laboratory for automated process model discovery. Our study shows that process mining, with the use of relevant KPIs, provides valuable insights for laboratories that motivates the disclosure and increased utilization of laboratory event data, which in turn drive the analytical staff to intervene in the process to achieve the set performance goals.

That modern deep neural networks generalize well despite a large number of parameters contradicts this finding and constitutes a major unsolved problem towards explaining the success of deep learning. While previous work focuses on the implicit regularization induced by stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we study here how the local geometry of the energy landscape around local minima affects the statistical properties of SGD with Gaussian gradient noise. We argue that under reasonable assumptions, the local geometry forces SGD to stayclose to a low dimensional subspace and that this induces another form of implicit regularization and results in tighter bounds on the generalization error for deep neural networks. To derive generalization error bounds for neural networks,we first introduce a notion of stagnation sets around the local minima and impose a local essential convexity property of the population risk. Under these conditions, lower bounds for SGD to remain in these stagnation sets are derived. If stagnation occurs,we derive a bound on the generalization error of deep neural networks involving the spectral norms of the weight matrices but not the number of network parameters. Technically, our proofs are based on controlling the change of parameter values in theSGD iterates and local uniform convergence of the empirical loss functions based on the entropy of suitable neighborhoods around local minima.","2023-02","2025-03-07 13:14:27","2025-03-07 13:26:22","2025-03-07 13:26:22","1203-1223","","2","69","","IEEE Trans.

Thus, making them cost-efficient is essential to secure their proliferation. This paper proposes a new method for the optimal design of microgrids. The proposed two-stage method optimizes the size and the location of the DERs, i.e., the renewable energy sources (RESs), distributed generation (DG) units, and battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Furthermore, the overall operation of the microgrid is optimized using a stochastic scenario-based approach, considering grid-connected and unintentional islanded modes. The proposed method also considers internal network reinforcements. Thus, the first stage is an energy-based approach, formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, and it is used to size the DERs, whereas the second stage uses an optimal AC power flow (AC-OPF) to formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model that allocates the DERs and selects the best conductor for each circuit. The multi-objective nature of the problem is addressed via Pareto optimization to analyze the trade-off between operational and capital costs. The MINLP model is linearized through piece-wise approximations and solved using commercial solvers.

We refer to this ratio as the robustness factor. We give an algorithm with a robustness factor 2-1/m for the most general setting and improve this to 1.8 for equal-size jobs. For the special case of infinitesimal jobs, we give an algorithm with an optimal robustness factor equal to e/(e-1)≈1.58.

Focused crawlers meet this demand by crawling and indexing specific parts of the Web. Critically, a focused crawler must quickly find new pages that have not yet been indexed. Since a new page can be discovered only by following a new outlink, predicting new outlinks is very relevant in practice. In the literature, many feature designs have been proposed for predicting changes in the Web. In this work we provide a structured analysis of this problem, using new outlinks as our running prediction target. Specifically, we unify earlier feature designs in a taxonomic arrangement of features along two dimensions: static versus dynamic features, and features of a page versus features of the network around it. Within this taxonomy, complemented by our new (mainly, dynamic network) features, we identify best predictors for new outlinks. Our main conclusion is that most informative features are the recent history of new outlinks on a page itself, and of its content-related pages. Hence, we propose a new ‘look back, look around’ (LBLA) model, that uses only these features. With the obtained predictions, we design a number of scoring functions to guide a focused crawler to pages with most new outlinks, and compare their performance. The LBLA approach proved extremely effective, outperforming other models including those that use a most complete set of features. One of the learners we use, is the recent NGBoost method that assumes a Poisson distribution for the number of new outlinks on a page, and learns its parameters. This connects the two so far unrelated avenues in the literature: predictions based on features of a page, and those based on probabilistic modeling. All experiments were carried out on an original dataset, made available by a commercial focused crawler.","2023-01","2025-03-07 13:14:27","2025-03-07 13:26:11","2025-03-07 13:26:11","110126","","","260","","Knowledge-Based Systems","Look back, look around","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: f7fa6096e9c44e008c02cd9768ef0e03 Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","UT-Hybrid-D; Focused crawling; Probabilistic regression; Statistical models; Web change prediction; Web mining; Web search engines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In general, although it is less laborious and more efficient to collect CLs compared with ordinary labels, the less informative signal in the complementary supervision is less helpful to learn competent feature representation. Consequently, the final classifier's performance greatly deteriorates. In this article, we leverage generative adversarial networks (GANs) to derive an algorithm GAN-CL to effectively learn from CLs. In addition to the role in original GAN, the discriminator also serves as a normal classifier in GAN-CL, with the objective constructed partly with the complementary information. To further prove the effectiveness of our schema, we study the global optimality of both generator and discriminator for the GAN-CL under mild assumptions. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark image datasets using deep models, to demonstrate the compelling improvements, compared with state-of-the-art CL learning approaches.","2023-01","2025-03-07 13:14:27","2025-03-07 13:26:27","2025-03-07 13:26:27","236-247","","1","53","","IEEE Trans.

This is a practically relevant and challenging problem which current methods are able to solve only under strong assumptions on the training set. Here we propose a new method that requires minimal assumptions on the data, and prove reconstruction rates that depend on the number of training points and the noise level. We show that, in the regime of “many” training data, the method is minimax opti-mal. The proposed method employs a type of convolutional neural networks (U-nets) and empirical risk minimization in order to “fit” the unknown op-erator. In a nutshell, our approach is based on two ideas: the first is to relate U-nets to multiscale decompositions such as wavelets, thereby linking them to the existing theory, and the second is to use the hierarchical structure of U-nets and the low number of parameters of convolutional neural nets to prove entropy bounds that are practically useful. A significant difference with the existing works on neural networks in nonparametric statistics is that we use them to approximate operators and not functions, which we argue is mathematically more natural and technically more convenient.","2023-01-01","2025-03-07 13:14:27","2025-03-07 13:26:12","2025-03-07 13:26:12","723–768","","1","17","","Electron.

To address the aforementioned problem, this paper proposes detecting FDIAs considering visual data. The aim of visual state estimation is to enhance the resilience and security of renewable energy systems. This approach provides an additional layer of defense against cyber attacks, ensuring the integrity and reliability of solar power generation data and facilitating the efficient and secure operation of EMS. The proposed approach uses a modified VGG-16 neural network model to obtain an intermediate representation that provides textual and numerical explanations about the visual weather conditions from sky images.
